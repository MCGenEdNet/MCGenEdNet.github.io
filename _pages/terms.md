## Call for Fellows

## Potential Projects

The sample projects listed below are appropriate for the six month duration of the traineeships. The landscape of possible projects is intentionally wide, varying from projects where only limited domain knowledge is required, to projects where a detailed knowledge of particle or nuclear physics is needed. Similarly, these projects require different levels of technical/software development skills.\

We have purposefully left space to tailor projects to the background of our students. In most cases, we assume that a one to two month initial period is needed for a student to become familiar with a particular MC tool, and the remainder of the stay is devoted to actual code development. For very advanced graduate students or junior postdoctoral researchers, it will also be possible to match them with even more ambitious projects, or even for them to work on projects that they themselves propose. As such, the examples below should be taken only as guidance, as the list will be adjusted and extended during the duration of the MCgen program, reflecting developments in the particle and nuclear physics domain.
