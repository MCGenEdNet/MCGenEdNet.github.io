## Background

An integral part of a learning process is applying the acquired skills to concrete problems. An important part of the MCgen program is thus a mentoring program, where a group of selected graduate students and junior postdoctoral researchers will work on carefully crafted projects under the guidance of the senior members. These projects will have an immediate impact on the particle/nuclear physics community, since the students will be either developing and improving existing MC programs, developing new ML solutions to physics problems, or building tools and interfaces. At the same time, the skills developed by the students will be applicable to a wide set of problems, well beyond the particle/nuclear physics domain. The selection process and sample projects are listed below (students are also allowed to propose their own project in consulation with one of the senior members).  Students would be selected from a national competition and would remain enrolled at their home institution. MCgen traineeships provide financial support to students so that they can focus on their project at the institution of the mentor (UC Berkeley or Cincinnati in the pilot phase of MCgen).

## Call for Fellows

The participants in the eight 6-month long traineeships will be selected from a national pool of graduate students at institutions in the US. We will have two calls for the positions: four positions will be offered each for year 1 (YR1) and then for year 2 (YR2), equally split among the two host campuses. Advertisement of positions and the selection process will follow best practices to create an inclusive and equitable interview process. 

## Eligibility

Be a graduate student or junior postdoc at a UC institution.  The students are not required to be US citizens.

## Benefits

Fellows will recieve a stipiend of about $25k (a little more in Berkeley and a little less in Cincinnati to account for the cost of living).  This is likely not enough to cover an entire semester/summer, so they will still need to be at least partially funded by their home institute.  The host institute will provide office space and a working environment to collaborate on the selected project.

## Selection

Applicants will be requested to submit a brief (1 page) description of their proposed research project, including the preferred host institution, their CV (including software experience), and two letters of recommendation. The rubric for selecting students will consist of multiple components based on these inputs. We will conduct video interviews with short-listed candidates, paying attention to not introduce unintentional biases (the questions will be standardized, while in the email communications prior to the interview we will also provide in advance the video interview best practices, including recommendations for lighting and audio). All four senior members will participate in the selection. The selected candidates will be placed equally between the two institutions, based on their preferences, and will each be assigned a primary mentor.

In the period of about two months prior to the start of the traineeship the primary mentor will have a series of Zoom meetings with the mentee. In this way, the students can potentially begin relevant readings or self-tutorials in advance, if this would be beneficial for them (we also anticipate an initial ramp-up period at the host site), while the mentor can also more easily make sure that the administrative preparations for the move are running smoothly. Once the students will be physically present at the host institution's campus, they will be included in the regular group activities (weekly seminars, journal clubs, group meetings), as well as in social activities.

## Potential Projects

The sample projects listed below are appropriate for the six month duration of the traineeships. The landscape of possible projects is intentionally wide, varying from projects where only limited domain knowledge is required, to projects where a detailed knowledge of particle or nuclear physics is needed. Similarly, these projects require different levels of technical/software development skills.

We have purposefully left space to tailor projects to the background of our students. In most cases, we assume that a one to two month initial period is needed for a student to become familiar with a particular MC tool, and the remainder of the stay is devoted to actual code development. For very advanced graduate students or junior postdoctoral researchers, it will also be possible to match them with even more ambitious projects, or even for them to work on projects that they themselves propose. As such, the examples below should be taken only as guidance, as the list will be adjusted and extended during the duration of the MCgen program, reflecting developments in the particle and nuclear physics domain.
